Lab - Register DHD Device with Silverline
---------------------------------------------

For Silverline signaling we will be leveraging both the DHD built-in signaling, 
as well as bandwidth utilization reporting for Hybrid DDoS protection.

In System->Platform change the hostname to <yourf5emailprefix>.f5demo.com. For 
example j.smith@f5.com would register as j.smith.f5demo.com. If you have more than 
one DHD environment registered to Silverline, add a number to make each DHD unique.

In Device Management->Devices select the device and then click “Change Device Name…”. 
Update the device name to match the hostname you have chosen.
